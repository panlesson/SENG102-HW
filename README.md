We got 2 version for our project to open version 1:

1- Click "Code" on the top right and then click "Download ZIP."

2- Right-click the downloaded zip file and select "Extract" to the Desktop or the location of your choice.(To work with the file, you need to extract it from the zip archive. You can simply open the zip file and drag the file out.)

Warning: If you want to open Version 2 for our project just open version 2 folder and start reading version2readme.txt

3- Open the extracted file and run "LibraryManagementSystem.exe."(The Antivirus Defender can block that action so if you get warning message just click more info and Run or just run changes by OS or AntiVirus Software. If you dont see exe file, open LibraryManagementSystem.cpp and Click Compile&Run(F11) while using DEVC++.)

4- To gain full access to the system, you need to log in as an admin.(Normal users can't manage other users, only admin can manage other users.) Enter the following:

-> Library Card Number: admin

-> PIN Number: admin

5- Once you have entered the system, you can utilize its features. When you are finished, simply type '0' in the main menu to exit.
